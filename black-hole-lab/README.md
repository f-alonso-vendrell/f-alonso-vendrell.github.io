# Black Hole Lab

## About

   A place to see what happens in the vecinity of a black hole, made of a set of experiments based on current knowledge on General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. 
   
   This place will be always on construction and will accept contributions in the form of additional experiments, enhancements of the Lab components or just discussions, error corrections or proposals (use https://github.com/f-alonso-vendrell/f-alonso-vendrell.github.io/issues with black-hole-lab label for that) on the settings and outcome.
   
## Lab Components

We have cleared up a portion of space of 15.000.000.000 light years around our Black Hole to have a nice environment to work with and we have put in it a black hole with the given characteristics for our experiments.

This lab has 4 components:
    
* The Black Hole: We can configure its Mass, Spin or Angular Momentum and Charge  
* The Cosmic Background: We have a Cosmic Background of 2.7K 
* The Probe: Powered with matter-antimatter motors and able to be refuelled while working the probe has the following features:
  * Has an internal clock
  * Can send light of any frecuency from any place(s) of its spherical surface
  * Can send coded information with the light emitted: position of the spherical surface and internal clock value 
  * Can be programmed to move and send light and information
* You:
  * Are inside a ship with same matter-antimatter motors as the probe
  * Your own clock
  * Have a set of camera sensors that can dectect light of any frequency, record the direction and decode the information the probe has sent
  * Have a set of filters to ease interpretation of information received:
    * Event horizon: an overlapping line showing where the event horizon is supossed to be
    * Flexi time: seeing things in real time can be very boring if you have to wait millions of years or you can miss something that happens in just fempto seconds. You can accelerate or slow the experiment data to see details
    * God sign: A warning sign that will appear if you ever cross the event horizon. As today we can not extract information out of a black hole so what we will be showing is a non testable hypothesis based on our current physical laws.

## Constrains

* Finite: Even spending very large ammounts of energy and time experimentes must have finite ammounts. This is also applicable to stress and tidal forces suffered by the probe or you, that means... never reaching the black hole singularity :(
* Measurement error: based on the tooling used there will always certain error as this lab is an aproximation of reality.
* Work in progress: As the experiment is prepared and coded there will be constrains due to the program used


## Experiment Structure

   Any experiment will consist on
   
### Set up

   the starting conditions of the experiment. Mass charge and angular momentum. probe position velocity. our position and velocity and how will the probe and us will move during the experiment. also how the probe will be programmed to send us information
   
### Hypothesis 

### Execution

### Explanation 

## Components Calibration

  Component calibration are experiments without or very far from the black hole
  
### Cal 1. Probe steady at 10 sec light from you sending periodic light pulses

### Cal 2. Probe at 10 sec light from you aproaching you at steady low speed sending periodic light pulses

### Cal 3. Probe at 10 sec light from you leaving you at steady low speed sending periodic light pulses
