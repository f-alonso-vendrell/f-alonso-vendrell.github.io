# Black Hole Lab

## About

   A place to see what happens in the vecinity of a black hole, made of a set of experiments based on current knowledge on General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. 
   
   This place will be always on construction and will accept contributions in the form of additional experiments, enhancements of the Lab components or just discussions, error corrections or proposals (use https://github.com/f-alonso-vendrell/f-alonso-vendrell.github.io/issues with black-hole-lab label for that) on the settings and outcome.
   
## Lab Components

We have cleaned up a portion of space of 15.000.000.000 light years around our Black Hole to have a nice environment to work with and we have put in it a black hole with the given characteristics for our experiments.

This lab has 4 components:
    
* The Black Hole: We can configure its Mass, Spin or Angular Momentum and Charge  
* The Cosmic Background: We have a Cosmic Background of 2.7K 
* The Probe: Powered with matter-antimatter motors and able to be refuelled while working the probe has the following features:
  * Has an internal clock
  * Can send light of any frecuency from any place(s) of its spherical surface
  * Can send coded information with the light emitted: position of the spherical surface and internal clock value 
* You:
